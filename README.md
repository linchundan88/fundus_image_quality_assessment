# Retinal-Image-Quality-Assessment
Analyse adequacy of a retinal image
This repository was forked from "https://github.com/appidiabhinav/Retinal-Image-Quality-Assessment" and did the following modifications: fixing a bug and adding support for Opencv4.2. This project(I'm just talking about this project not the original repository) has obsoleted because now we use deep learning methods.
